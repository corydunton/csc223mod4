/**
 * Coin Change Calculator Assignment
 *
 * Given a valid monetary double value, the objective of this assignment is to
 * implement the calculateChange method that will determine the fewest coins
 * required to make the leftover change (i.e., excluding the dollar amount).
 *
 * For example, if the input is 3.48, your method should consider only the 0.48
 * to determine the coins needed.
 *
 * Instructions: 1. Implement the calculateChange method. 2. Ensure that you use
 * the fewest number of coins. 3. The order of coins in the returned array
 * should be [# of quarters, # of dimes, # of nickels, # of pennies]. 4. Test
 * your method with the provided JUnit5 tests.
